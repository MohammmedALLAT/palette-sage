## 🧠 How It Works

Palette Sage uses intelligent color extraction and contrast algorithms to ensure every palette is both **aesthetically pleasing** and **accessible**.

If your project integrates APIs (e.g., color extraction or image analysis), you can easily configure them using environment variables in your Vercel dashboard.

## ⚙️ Environment Variables (if using APIs)

If your app needs any API keys (for example, OpenAI, ColorMind, or Unsplash), create a `.env.local` file in your project root and define:

```bash
API_KEY=your_api_key_here
API_URL=https://api.example.com
